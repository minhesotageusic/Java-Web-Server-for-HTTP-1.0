# Java Web Server for HTTP 1.0
<p>This project was done for RU CS 352, fall semester, 2020</p>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>In this project we've designed a simple web server in Java that support a subset of HTTP 1.0 protocol. Out webserver is able to accept incoming socket connections, read request from client, and answer client with appropriate HTTP status code.</p>
<h4>Supported HTTP 1.0 protocols</p>
<ul>
    <li> GET </li>
    <li> HEAD </li>
    <li> POST </li>
</ul>
<h4>This project only provides code for the webserver, you will need to create your own client using socket to connect to the webserver</h4>
